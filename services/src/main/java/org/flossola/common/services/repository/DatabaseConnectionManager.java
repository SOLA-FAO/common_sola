/**
 * Provides common functionality for configuring and managing the Mybatis database connection.
 * The CommonRepositoryImpl creates a DatabaseConnectionManager and configures it with the settings
 * from the mybatisConnectionConfig.xml that is included with each EJB in the default resources
 * package. 
 * <p>
 * The DatabaseConnectionManager supports two data sources, a sharedDataSource and a 
 * specificDataSource. The configuration for each data source is included in the 
 * mybatisConnectionConfig.xml. The sharedDataSource is intended for development and testing
 * where one JNDI data source is used by all EJB's to connect to the database. The specificDataSource
 * is intended for production environments where it may be desirable for each EJB to have its own
 * JDNI data source configured to connect to the database to avoid one database user with access
 * to all database tables.
 * </p>
 * <p> 
 * The databaseConnection property file can be configured to indicate whether the sharedDataSource
 * should be used for all EJB's or not. Note that this property file is configured using Maven 
 * filtering. Refer to the POM file for the Services Common (sola-services-common) project for 
 * details. 
 *</p>
 * <p>
 * Mybatis provides detailed logging of all SQL commands it executes as well the ability to log the
 * results of each SQL statement. To direct this logging output to the Glassfish Server Log use
 * Log Levels tab of the Logger Settings node in the Glassfish Admin Console to set the java.sql
 * and java.sql.Connection loggers to the FINE level. If you wish to log the results of each
 * SQL query, set java.sql.ResultSet to FINE as well, but be aware that logging all results may
 * negatively impact performance of the application.
